# Helmholtz Servo

The design contained here is an analogue PID controller, with some
peculiarities specific for controlling the current though the
Helmholtz coil of our apparatus.

## Status
This project is not yet in production use.


## Where to look

This repository contains the KiCad project for the controller. PDF
copies of the schematic, PCB, and documentation can be found in the
*Generated* folder.
